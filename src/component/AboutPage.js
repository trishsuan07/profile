      <p className="text-center">Hi Guys, I'm a total sweetheart with a bubbly personality. I love to bake and whip up delicious treats in the kitchen. When I'm not baking, you can find me on the volleyball court, showing off my skills. I'm also a dedicated CS student, tackling those coding challenges with a smile. And let's not forget, I love to be pampered and treated like a baby. </p>
